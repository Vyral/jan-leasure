Many of my clients in Libertyville have been asking me about a strange phenomenon called ***Zombie Foreclosures*. A Zombie Foreclosure is a situation that occurs when you have left your home and it has been foreclosed, but you are still on the title to the property.** This is essentially a property that is in your name because the bank did not come back and repurchase the property in a sherriff's sale.

It's extremely important to figure out if you are still on the title to the property because it can prevent you from purchasing a new home. **FHA rules state that you cannot make a new purchase until you are off of title for 36 months.**

**Zombie Foreclosures are difficult to detect and most loan officers will not take the time to do a thorough check for them.** However, there is one way to find out, and that is by contacting the Recorder of Deeds Office and purchasing a copy of the deed for your home. You can also call your local title company here in Libertyville and have them search for your name (this costs around $75).

**It's extremely important before going through the mortgage process to figure out if you have a Zombie Foreclosure because it could affect your buying power for years to come.** If you need any assistance in this process or if you would like to learn more about Zombie Foreclosures, please feel free to contact me via phone or email.&nbsp;
