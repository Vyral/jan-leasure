Now is the time to buy. But why? <br /><br />Housing prices have gone up by 5 percent in the last year and interest rates have increased by about a point. That may not seem like a lot, but let’s look at how the increase affects your purchasing power. <br /><br />A year ago you could buy a $180,000, put a down a payment of 10 percent and have a principal and interest payment of $725 a month.<br /><br />This year that same home is now $189,000. With the increase of interest rates added, your monthly payment is now $862. That’s more than one hundred dollars in difference each month. <br /><br />If your budget is $725, you must scale back the price range of homes you’re looking at to around $160,000. <br /><br />We have no idea where interest rates will be next year.
