I recently got a chance to drink some wine and share my backstory on the very first episode of “#WineAboutLife.” I hope you enjoy!

On my recent appearance on “#WineAboutLife,” I got to talk with host
Nik Champion about the experiences I’ve had that made me who I
am today. Nik Champion is the owner of Champion Allstate in Warrenville, IL.

Nik can be reached at 630-332-2555 or via email at
championagency@allstate.com

For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of the interview
so you can jump ahead at your leisure:

0:54—Two important events that shaped my mantra on life
2:47—How I apply this mindset to my business
3:47—The best advice I could ever give to anyone
5:02—The most emotionally gratifying mortgage transaction
I’ve ever participated in  
7:19—How I got my nickname: “The Lake County Loan Goddess”
8:39—Other niche services I offer, including being a CLDP
Nik is always looking for more businesspeople and community
leaders to sit down for a future episode of “#WineAboutLife,” so
if you’re interested in being interviewed, go ahead and reach out
to him!

As always, if you have any questions for me or there’s anything I can help
you with, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to help you.
