Friends,

 The 2018 holiday season has officially begun! We hope you are as excited
as we are.

 We’d like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of you this
Thanksgiving. We have met some truly wonderful people, and we’re
proud to have helped so many reach their real estate goals over the years.


We wouldn’t be where we are today without all of your support.


Enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner with all of your family and friends—
that’s what we plan to do!

 In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us if you have
any real estate questions. We would be happy to help you.

 Happy Thanksgiving,

 Jan Leasure
