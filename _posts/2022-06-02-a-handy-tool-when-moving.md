Today in our Mortgage Minute, I have some important information to share with homebuyers that doesn’t have to do with interest rates, negotiating price, or anything except moving. First, let me share two quick secrets about myself:

1\. I hate moving.&nbsp;

2\. I like having my stuff around me—it makes me feel comfortable.

However, what happens if you’re like me and it’s time for you to move? I’ve put off moving for a long time and don’t think I’ll move anytime soon, but I did develop a very useful tool to help those of you who are planning to soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**I put together a document that you can see at 2:16 in the video above called “Jan’s Handy Moving Guide.”** You can’t imagine all the things you have to do and all the things that come up when moving, but I tried my hardest to break everything down in this guide. What if you have a lot of jewelry like me? How do you pack that? How much do movers cost? It answers all of these questions and more.

If I was moving, the first thing I would do would be to make enough money to pay someone else to do it for me. However, that’s not the reality for most of us. **[If you can’t afford professional movers and have to move on your own, I want you to download my moving guide here.](/uploads/MOVING-CHECKLIST_new-Jan-Flyer.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** If you love me enough that you have my email or phone number, you can also reach out directly and I’ll send you a copy myself.

If you have any other questions for me about moving or buying a home in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you, and happy moving\!
