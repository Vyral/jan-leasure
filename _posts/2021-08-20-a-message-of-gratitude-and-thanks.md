I wanted to reach out and say “Thank you” to everyone who helped me have a great year in 2020. It’s a little late, but I wanted to express my gratitude nevertheless. **I was recently recognized as one of the top 1% of loan officers nationally for 2020.&nbsp;**

It was my honor to help so many people and continue to serve people through an otherwise disastrous year. Thank you to everyone who helped along the way in making me a top loan officer. It was a lot of work but also a lot of fun.&nbsp;

**A special message of thanks goes out to our great clients, our exhaustive Realtors who work with me side by side, our dedicated title officers that helped with smooth closings, our insurance agents, attorneys, and everyone who worked in tandem to help us achieve this goal.** I’d also like to thank Diamond Residential Mortgage Corporation for giving me the opportunity to stay busy, and thanks to my team right here in Libertyville for being so dedicated.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me or any mortgage needs I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.
