Are you noticing the trend of entire complexes of homes being built just for rent? It's becoming increasingly common, with the promise of a simplified lifestyle where you rent everything rather than own it. This shift raises important questions about your goals: do you aim for home ownership, or are you content with a future where you own nothing? Let's dive into this growing phenomenon and explore what it means for your financial future.

Recently, I've noticed they're building entire complexes of homes just for rent. Just look at what they're saying: "Home. Simplified." That's right. It's simple because you don't own anything. You'll rent everything from them. It's a straightforward model, but it raises a crucial question for me: Is my goal home ownership, or do I want to end up not owning anything?

There is a trend that's spreading across the United States, where large corporations are buying up single-family homes, apartment buildings, condos, and townhomes. They're fixing them up a bit and turning them into rentals because they want to keep us from experiencing home ownership and building equity. As a loan officer, homeowner, and someone who's been in real estate since I was 21, my recommendation is clear: strive for ownership and grow your equity. Don't let this trend dictate your financial future.
