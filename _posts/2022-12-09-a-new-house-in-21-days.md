Do you know what time it is? It's time to write your letter to Santa. I don't know what's on your Christmas list, but if it happens to be a new home and you'd like to be in your house sitting in front of your fireplace before Christmas, **we can close a loan in 21 days or less.**

Get hopping on your contract and give me a call at [(847) 362-1335](tel:&#40;847&#41; 362-1335). I'd love to be your lender.
