Anyone who follows my antics here at Diamond Residential Mortgage knows that I also have a passion for moms and babies in Lake County. I'm on the board of Directors for Keeping Families Covered, a local charitable organization. Since its inception, Keeping Families Covered has distributed almost 5 million diapers to needy families in Lake County, Illinois. I know I’m always hosting diaper drives and soliciting for donations, but today I am knocking on your kind hearts.

Our annual fundraiser has not taken place for two years because of COVID, so I would like you to consider joining us on **September 24 at Cuneo Mansion in Vernon Hills** for a wonderful evening to celebrate Keeping Families Covered and raise money for our cause. Tickets are $250 each. There will be a champagne reception, appetizers, dinner, and a fabulous speaker. To order tickets, please [call](tel:847-362-1335){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [email me](mailto:Jan.Leasure@drmconline.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, or go to [keepingfamiliescovered.org](http://keepingfamiliescovered.org) where you can also download the event flyer.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I hope you can join us.
