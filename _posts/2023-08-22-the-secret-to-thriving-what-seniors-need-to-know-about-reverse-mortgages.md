Today, I’m excited to be showing you a video from Miami, Florida! I’m here to learn all about reverse mortgages, a product I’ve been helping people with for a long time. But there are a lot of great changes happening.&nbsp;

**If you’re over 62 or know someone who is, and if you want to stay in your house forever without having another mortgage payment, you might want to consider a reverse mortgage.** If you want to know more about this concept, watch my Instagram reels with all the important information. Until then, call or email me if you need anything. I look forward to working with you!
