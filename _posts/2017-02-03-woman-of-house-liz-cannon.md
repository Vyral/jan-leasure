Are you curious why so many people choose us to help them buy and sell homes? Let Liz Cannon tell you.

Here at Liberty Mortgage, we value our clients’ well-being above all else. As a testament to our dedication and the quality of service we provide, today we’ve brought in a former client of ours, Liz Cannon, to share her experience of working with us.

“I could not be happier with Jan and her team and their services, hard work, and dedication,” Liz says. “They seriously were a lifesaver during the home buying process and I highly recommend if you are a first-time home buyer or looking to refinance your home that she’s the first person you call.”



Liz met Jan during a guest lecture she gave about mortgages at the College of Lake County in 2014. She left such a favorable impression that Liz was the first person she contacted when she and her husband decided to buy a house last year. Jan remembered Liz from their encounter and immediately invited her and her husband into her office for a thorough consultation.

“She really does go the extra mile for her clients. She’s very charismatic. She used to be a teacher, so she’s great at explaining things in a way that isn’t confusing, and she doesn’t make you feel stupid for asking any sorts of questions. I highly recommend her and I’d never buy a house without her.”

It was our pleasure to be able to help Liz and her husband buy their first house. If you are thinking about buying a home, please don’t hesitate to contact us. It would be our pleasure to help you too.
