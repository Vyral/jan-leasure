Timing is everything. As a seasoned veteran in both the real estate and mortgage industries, I’ve learned that there’s a strategic advantage to listing your house the day after the Super Bowl. Better believe it because statistics don’t lie, and according to Google, searches from prospective homebuyers spiked by a whopping 38% following the Super Bowl.

But why should you list your home now? It is because **this surge in interest can be an opportunity for sellers to beat the rush of listings** that come with a spring market from April to June and get top dollar for their home. To stay ahead of the game, sellers should start cleaning and call their Realtors.

The buyer, on the other hand, is having a hard time because of low inventory. However, inventory starts picking up once more in mid-February, giving buyers more choices to choose from in all markets.

**Note that contracts will go to the buyers who are pre-approved, so that should be your main priority** if you are looking to buy a house. Make sure that your credit is in good order and gather your documentation, like paystubs, bank statements, or W-2s.
