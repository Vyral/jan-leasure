Do you know someone from another country like Mexico, Canada, China, or my homeland, Italy? If they don’t have a social security number, they’re likely working with an ITIN, or an individual taxpayer identification number.

**I bet you didn’t know that you could qualify for a mortgage with an ITIN.** I can get you a loan, but there are a few things you need first. You’ll need at least two years of work history in the U.S., a valid ITIN number and supporting documentation, and a down payment of 15% or more.

With an ITIN, you can buy a primary residence, a second home, or a one- to four-unit property that you live in as an owner-occupant. However, you can’t buy investment properties.

If you have any questions, feel free to call or email me. You can also download [this flier](/uploads/itin-borrower-download-2022.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to learn more about getting a loan with an ITIN.
