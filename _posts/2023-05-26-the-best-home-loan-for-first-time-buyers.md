Let’s be honest—purchasing your first home can be a little scary. There are so many choices and things to think about that it’s easy to become overwhelmed. For example, which type of financing should you use? Many first-time buyers find it difficult to qualify for conventional loans, and while adjustable-rate mortgages are a great option, some buyers don’t want to take on the added risk. Fortunately, there’s a type of home loan that’s perfect for first-time homebuyers: FHA loans. Here are three of the most important ways FHA loans help first-time buyers:

**1\. They have flexible financial standards.** Are you worried that your credit score or debt-to-income ratio might not be good enough for a conventional mortgage? Since FHA loans are federally insured, lenders are less strict about financial requirements for these loans. Most conventional loans require a credit score of 620, but many FHA mortgages only require a score of 580. Plus, many lenders will qualify people with scores as low as 500 if they can afford a down payment of 10% or more.

**2\. They have low down payment requirements.** According to most first-time buyers, the biggest hurdle when it comes to buying a home is saving up for a down payment. Most people think you need 20% down to purchase a home, but with an FHA loan, you can put down as little as 3.5%. If saving for a down payment has been keeping you from fulfilling your dream of owning a home, an FHA loan could be perfect for you.&nbsp;

**3\. They might have better interest rates.** In some circumstances, FHA loans might allow you to get a lower interest rate than a conventional loan. Plus, your interest rate will be fixed, so you won’t have to worry about it increasing later, as it does with adjustable-rate mortgages. At the end of the day, your interest rate is determined by a wide variety of factors, so talk to your lender and see which loan gets you the best rate possible.&nbsp;

FHA loans may not be for everyone, but they might just be the best option for first-time buyers looking to make their dreams a reality.
