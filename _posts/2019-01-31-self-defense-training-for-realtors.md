How many of you watching this knew that I was a Realtor?

There were a number of times that I was showing a home or sitting an open house and I was extremely uncomfortable.

Fortunately for me, there was never a disaster, but looking back after watching the Beverly Carter story about an agent who was tortured and killed during a showing and reading local headlines I felt that it was important to provide some sort of training to help keep our Lake County agents safe.

I recently attended a self defense class sponsored by two police officers, Anne and Kevin at Crossfit Freedom in Libertyville and decided that this is exactly the type of  skill that our agents need to be prepared for any situation.

I am sponsoring a Realtor Safety & Self Defense party and Luncheon on February 7th from 11am – 1pm, cohosted by Real Estate Attorney, Shameen Thakrar. Come dressed to play, be hungry, lunch will be provided by Real Clean Paleo our favorite healthy food!  

 Go home with skills and swag.  

 The regular price is $45 per person, but my sponsorship will cover $25 of that so your cost for the class and lunch is $20! You can RSVP at the Empower Self-Defense Facebook page or on my business page, Jan Leasure Diamond Residential Mortgage.

Let’s make 2019 Safe and Prosperous!
