In the end, renting is rarely a better investment than buying real estate, except in necessary short-term situations. In 2022, the average rent price increased by more than 25% over last year (and in some communities rates have gone up more than 60%\!) Even with a 7% interest rate, buying is still a better alternative. Check out [this article](https://insurify.com/insights/cities-rising-rents-2022/) from Insurify for more details.&nbsp;
