Moving into a new house is exciting, but let me tell you—it’s easy to miss some small, important details. These things might seem minor now, but they can save you money, time, and frustration later. Here are the four things you need to check as soon as you move in (or even before):

**Does the doorbell work?** Be honest—when was the last time you thought about your doorbell? For most people, the answer is “never.” But here’s the thing: if it doesn’t work, it’s not just annoying—it’s inconvenient. I replaced mine with a Ring doorbell, and it’s been a game-changer. It works, and I can also see who’s at my door anytime, from anywhere. Plus, it’s great for keeping an eye on packages. If your doorbell doesn’t work, fix it. Better yet, upgrade it.

**Are all the outlets working?** This one’s sneaky. Even if your home inspector checked the outlets, things can change between inspection and move-in days. Some outlets might stop working, and you won’t know until you need them. Dead outlets are not just frustrating—they can be a safety hazard. Go through your house, plug something into every outlet, and test them. If any don’t work, fix or replace them. Electricity isn’t something to ignore.

**Are your ceiling fans spinning the right way?** Here’s a fun fact I didn’t know until recently: the direction your ceiling fan spins can affect your energy bills. Yep, you read that right. Switching the fan’s direction can save up to 10% on cooling and heating costs. For summer, the blades should spin counterclockwise to push cool air down. In winter, reverse it clockwise to circulate warm air. It’s simple, but it makes a big difference.

**Is the bathroom caulk fresh?** This one is critical. Check the caulk around your tubs, showers, and sinks. Old, cracked caulk can lead to mold, leaks, and expensive repairs. Re-caulk those areas to keep everything looking clean and to avoid problems later. It’s quick, easy, and worth it.

These four checks can save you so much trouble down the line. Don’t skip them. Take a few hours to go through your new house and handle these small tasks. Remember, it’s your home—make it work for you from day one. **If you have any questions, feel free to call or text me at 847-293-2111.**
