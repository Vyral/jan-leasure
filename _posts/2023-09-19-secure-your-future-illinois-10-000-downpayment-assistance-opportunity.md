If you've been dreaming of owning your first home in Illinois, we've got some fantastic news for you. Illinois first-time homebuyers, or those who haven't owned a home in the last 36 months, now have the opportunity to qualify for a generous $10,000 in downpayment assistance. The best part? You won't need to repay this assistance until you decide to sell your home. Let's dive into the details of this exciting program offered by the Illinois Housing Development Association (IRA).

The program is designed to make homeownership more accessible to a wide range of individuals. Whether you're purchasing a modest home for $100,000 or investing in a more substantial property priced at $500,000, you can qualify for the $10,000 in downpayment assistance, as long as you meet the program's criteria.

**This program provides a flat fee of $10,000 in downpayment assistance.** This amount can be used to cover your downpayment or assist with closing costs, making it easier for you to take that important step towards homeownership. One of the standout features of this program is that it doesn't require you to make monthly payments. Instead, you only need to repay the assistance when you decide to sell your home. This gives you the financial flexibility you need as a first-time homebuyer.

While this program is an incredible opportunity, it's important to note that its duration is uncertain. We don't know how long it will be available, so it's essential to take advantage of this opportunity while it lasts.
