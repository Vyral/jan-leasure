We have a crazy market right now. Just last month, a real estate agent friend of mine showed 50 homes to around 20 different clients and wrote 20 contracts, only to end up with no contracts accepted at all. It’s a great time to be a seller, but not an ideal time for buyers because of tight competition.&nbsp;

If you’re someone who lives in a tiny or old home, and you’re looking to live in a house that can accommodate your needs, what other options do you have since the market conditions are not in your favor? For cases like this, I can help you **get a home renovation loan so you can upgrade your home** to a much more livable place that can satisfy the demands of your lifestyle.

For any of your renovation lending concerns, don’t hesitate to call or email me so we can schedule an appointment and get started with your [home renovations](/uploads/Borrower-Renovation-Punch-List-Flyer-2022.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I’ll be happy to help\!
