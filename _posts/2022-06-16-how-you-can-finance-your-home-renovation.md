We have a crazy market right now. Just last month, a real estate agent friend of mine showed 50 homes to around 20 different clients and wrote 20 contracts, only to end up with no contracts accepted at all. It’s a great time to be a seller, but not an ideal time for buyers because of tight competition.&nbsp;

If you’re someone who lives in a tiny or old home, and you’re looking to live in a house that can accommodate your needs, what other options do you have since the market conditions are not in your favor? For cases like this, I can help you **get a home renovation loan so you can upgrade your home** to a much more livable place that can satisfy the demands of your lifestyle.
