Today we wanted to show you around our office and introduce you to everyone on the team.

**Afumi Pendelton** is our director of first impressions and loan coordinator. She will sign you in to the office, collect your documents, and ensure that everything gets signed.&nbsp;

**Jessica Belmontes** is our loan officer and Jan’s right hand. She’ll help you through the loan process, and she also has a background in banking.

**Daniela Gomez** is our resident loan processor (or loan wizard). She makes sure that your documents meet federal and state guidelines and then submits them to underwriting. She’ll work closely with you to make sure you get through underwriting as quickly as possible. She’s also fluent in Spanish\!

**John Bloss** is our senior loan officer. He helps the team keep moving forward.

Of course, we can't forget our official greeter, Sammi, the dog\!

Thank you for taking the time to meet our team. We hope you think of us the next time you or your friends or family need a mortgage. Just call or email us; we’d be happy to help you.
