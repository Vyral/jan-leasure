I hope your 2023 is off to a good start! Lately, my calendar has been filled up with a lot of weddings and showers. Some of the happy couples are my clients who want to ditch their $2,000 a month in rent (which is $24,000 a year if you add it up) and buy a home.&nbsp;

The problem is, with paying such high rent every month on top of all of their other expenses, one of my clients didnâ€™t know how they were going to save for a down payment on a home. We thought about this for a little while, and I came up with an idea. **We went to their local bank and set up an account in their name that was earmarked for their bridal registry.&nbsp;**

On their invitations, they told their guests that they could buy them a gift or contribute to the purchase of their brand-new home. **After 90 days, they had enough money for a down payment of 3.5% on a $200,000 home.** We were very excited!&nbsp;

If you want to know how you can do this, or if you know some first-time homebuyers who would like to buy a home, I would love to help. Call or email me anytime!
