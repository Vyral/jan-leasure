The old adage goes, “You never get anything unless you ask for it.” That’s why I'm asking you to do me a favor and **refer your friends, family, and neighbors to me, Jan Leisure at Diamond Residential Mortgage.**

Are your kids living in the basement? Send them over, and I can qualify them to have their own home and get out of your hair. Are you or a friend of yours divorcing? I’m a certified lending divorce planner, so I can fix your credit and maybe even save your marriage so you can move back in together.

Are your neighbors expecting twins and need a larger home? We can help them with rehab loans. Did you experience a kitchen disaster and need a remodel? I can help you there too. Do you have friends from another country working in the USA without a Social Security number, but they have an I10? I can help you with that as well.

You can easily refer people to me by having them call me, send me an email, or message me via text, Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn. Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing from you.
