The old adage goes, “You never get anything unless you ask for it.” That’s why I'm asking you to do me a favor and **refer your friends, family, and neighbors to me, Jan Leisure at Diamond Residential Mortgage.**

Are your kids living in the basement? Send them over, and I can qualify them to have their own home and get out of your hair. Are you or a friend of yours divorcing? I’m a certified lending divorce planner, so I can fix your credit and maybe even save your marriage so you can move back in together.

Are your neighbors expecting twins and need a larger home? We can help them with rehab loans. Did you experience a kitchen disaster and need a remodel? I can help you there too. Do you have friends from another country working in the USA without a Social Security number, but they have an I10? I can help you with that as well.

You can easily refer people to me by having them **[call me, send me an email, or message me](https://mortgagemoneygirl.com/uploads/REFER-ME-.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** via text, Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn. Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing from you.
