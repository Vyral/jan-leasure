Today, I just wanted to take a moment and talk about gratitude. It’s so important to show your thankfulness for the things you have in life, and there are two things I wanted to share with you.&nbsp;

The first is that I just came out of a business meeting with a first-time homebuyer. We were able to secure financing for that buyer, and she was so grateful for the opportunity. **She said that we had changed her life.**

The second thing is that when I returned to my office, I had a present of flowers waiting for me. At first I thought that these were from the client, but they were actually from my team\! Many people think that I work alone on these mortgages, but the fact is that I have a great team behind me. **The flowers were a token of appreciation for being a mentor to them.**

I wanted to give this brief message of thanks to my whole team for all of their hard work. Of course, I want to thank all of you, friends and clients, who have trusted me throughout the years.

If you have any mortgage-related questions, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.
